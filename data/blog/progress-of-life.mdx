# I've moved to California!

I must admit I've moved to California a while ago! This post was meant to be posted on February 9th, 2023. Today is March 20, 2024. My lease ended Feb 30th. 

## SMSC (Skate Mob Skate Crew) Hits Houston

It's been a busy time since before I moved to now. I literally have been busy since the 20th of January when SMSC Elijah Williams and Josh Bear came to Houston on a skate trip. That trip was a super busy one. We literally skated every single day. We also drank almost every single day and had fun hanging out. The little rain aint stop none.

- video coming soon along with a blog post

## Hanging with friends 

So the hard part about moving is saying farewell to friends. That crunch against time to make as many more memories as you can before you have to leave. It's a new beginning but I have to say I miss my friends. I miss being able to just hit them up ðŸ“³ and hang out with them. I miss all the times we had. We did make some new memories before I left and it was nothing but great memories before leaving Houston. 

#### P.S.
- photos and videos will be posted along with blog post

## Packing (This is always more than you think)

Packing is such a chore. It doesn't matter how much or less you have. If you aren't packed and boxed up the week before its time to move... <b className=" uppercase">You are screwing yourself over.</b> You are in over your head. Especially if you plan to hang out with friends and move really far - like from Texas to California. Driving at that. 

<b>To Be Transparent</b> - I literally was packing up until it was the day to move. I was going through every single thing I had to decide what's give away, what's going with me, and what's going to storage. I fill up a 10x5 storage (piano and all), my car was fit perfectly full with what came with me, and everything else was given away. (I donated everything)

## The Drive from Houston to Los Angeles

So I stayed in Houston for a few days after the lease ended. There was a bad ice/snow storm hitting the south. It literally affected the driving route and the planes. So I got to spend some more days with friends, go to some of my favorite spots like Prey, The Honey Hole, and The Flat on a Thursday. <span className="text-sm text-orange-300">(I'll post the content in a blog post)</span>.The day to leave came though.

<span className="text-lg text-purple-300">Once the weather died out, the snow melted, and the sky's were clear, it was time to leave. </span>
My mother was able to book a flight, so I picked her up and then hit the road. We did 12 hours to El Paso. The next day we did 12 Hours to Los Angeles. <span className="text-sm text-orange-300"> (I'll make a blog post of photos for this)</span>
Made to LA safely and welcomed with food from my Grandma :)

## Los Angeles

I must say Los Angeles was enjoyable. It was like I was on vacation in a way. No worries, stress, always had food made for me, and fresh margeritas or drink everynight while we watched tv together. Not only that, but I got to skate and meet some cool people. Mostly was enjoyable thanks to my brother <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedoctordapper">Eric Jones</a>. He has an event business called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theoutletla">The Outlet LA</a>, which throw grown and sexy events. Dress nice, have fun dancing, network with other elegant black people, and make a memory from an experience like none other. I literally went to 3 (or more of his events) in the 2 weeks I was in LA. More than the events though, is my bro showed me around town. Every place was chill and my vibe. <span className="text-sm text-orange-300">Pictures and videos to come for sure</span> Before this, I wasn't a fan of LA, but now that has changed. 
Another thing I did was went to the mountains with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chikitah_baybeh">Chikitah</a>. I have to post photos and videos from this as well, but this was a super experience. LA, you can be 45 from the beach, city, and mountains. Amenties!!!
Literally studied for the Sec+ exam every morning outside in the yard, sunbathing. 

## Creative Mari in California 

I have to discuss what's been happening now. So I've been fully open to growing. Internally and externally. Getting out of my own way and breaking down the box I had put up. Some of the things I was pushing off pursuing, I did until this moment and It's exciting that I have now begin pursuing it all. Last 6+ months was to web developing. I'm going to be updating <a href="https://www.jmariwyatt.com">My website</a> this week. I'm excited to publish it. <span className="text-sm text-orange-300">(ðŸ¤« New optional theme that includes 3D and new projects.ðŸ¤«)</span>

Now I'm able to do more creative things again like 2D/3D graphics & animations. My brain is just excited to create again. The world is mine to create again. Not just with those but with other technologies. I'm going all out. 

## LA To The Bay Area

So the day I left LA, I spent a night or two about an hour away from LA on the coast. I was hanging with a good friend of mine from long ago, like Eric. Longer though. I only remember when I left because I missed the new Supreme opening in Hollywood. I almost drove back for it but I had to keep moving forward. Once I actually drove, I hit the coast on the way to The Bay. It was an easy and nice drive. I got to Easy Bay after sun down. 
My Subaru Outback handled the drive like a fucking boss!

## The Bay Area

So now I'm bay living. I've been here for about a month now I think maybe. I finally got my first job in Cali, thats not contracts for digital works. Its working at a tire shop. lol. I have been networking and making moves to get my dreams up off the ground. I've met a good amount of people who I'm in discussions with to securing positions and larger, full time contracts, working for them. (Tech, skateboarding, and digital creations.) 


#### Life is Pretty & Beautiful 

I literally can see hills and mountains if I walk out of the apartment to the streets. It's a marvelous thing to experience every single day. I still haven't gotten used to it (thankfully). I literally wanted this and now I'm here. I went to the beach the other day and the cold weather couldn't match the serenity from being at the beach. 
I've found so much beauty in starting over and just going for what it is in life calling for me. I have other things calling for me also, but me being here will help me make those things possible. The potential for growth here is powerful and peaceful - like waves. 

## The Now

The now is everything. I'm currently just producing and living my life fully. Not 100%, although I'm putting forward the effort nonstop. It's exciting to be at place where I know, everthing I create passion, peace, and happiness with, is here. 
With my time, I've been just creating like none other - Creating websites, designs, characaters, videos, animations, and learning to creating motion graphics. 
I'm aiming to really push my skills to the next level. Not even just the productive ones, but also my negotiation skills, social skills, skateboarding skills, communication skills, and other life skills. There is a master me I'm aiming to be because I need to. The nows I have, are all going to making that happen. 

## Current Goals

1. Get my Sec+ by my Birthday, (May 30)
2. Get a role at a tech company within 6 months. (Maybe 3 months after my certificate)
3. By end of the year, I am aiming to finish all of the courses I purchased on Udemy. (This will actually be helpful for staying focused and scheduling)
4. Make $250,000 this year. (1 million next year)
5. Get closer to Adonai. 
6. Improve communication
7. Grow my youtube and blog (let's help people)
