## Lots To Come This Year 

It being the top of the year allows us the **power** to truly manifest and make our year what we want. 

This year I will be the best version of J'mari Wyatt, thus far. Working on consistency, love, faith, my relationship with God, communication, and being alive fully again. Maximizing on what I already have. Excel and thrive in the tech industry. Keeping the body, mind, soul, and spirit healthy. Enjoying San Fran and the bay for the experience it is. Building a team I will need. Attempt to get into Stanford or UC Berkeley for psychology.

We will have **Mari MultiMedia Services** fully operating, profitable, and respected. We will build the brand up to work with the likes of **Porsche**, **Supreme**, **Burberry**, or etc.

I will begin building the empire by starting J'mariko and my other brand idea. 

TLDR; The focuses:
- God
- Me (Growing, Developing, Maintaining)
- My Family and our Goals
- Mari MultiMedia Services
- J'mariko Empire
- SMSC 

I've made the decisions of what I want exactly. You should do the same. You should visisualize it, believe it, and see it happen.
