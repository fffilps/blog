summary: Who would've thought publishing a blog could be such a headache, even for a full-stack web developer. There were even headaches getting this far. I'm going to go over many of them, like choosing which platform to host from, which frameworks to build with, deciding how to scale the blog, and much more.

# MAKING A BLOG IS A LOT

Even when making the actual blog isn't a lot, making it still is. There are **SOOOOO** many parts that goes into making a blog. 

### THE TROUBLES FACING US

So lets just say the first trouble I faced was publishing this blog - which now I think about it, isn't my first problem because I had dilemmas before this one. 

Publishing a blog has many components. Lets first discuss those components. 
- Content Selection
- Scheduling
- Asking Yourself
    - What is the purpose of the blog?
    - What is the goal for the blog?
    - What's the vision for the blog? (Aesthetic)
    - Where am I going to host the blog?
    - Am I going to build the blog myself, use low/no code, or use a template?
    - Will this even work? Will it be worth my time? Do I even care?
    - How much do I share? How do I share the things?

Making a blog takes more thought than origanlly thought.

## The Purpose & The Goal

#### 'The Purpose' and 'The Goal' are two different things. 
**Purpose** is the overarching reason for doing something, while a **Goal** is a specific, measurable objective that helps you achieve your purpose.

### The Purpose 

This blogs main purpose is to be a resource. Resource for many of people, firstly. Me. 

A resource for me to share things I know, am learning, or things others are just interested in and I have the knowledge, access, and/or time to share.

> As I grow I want others to be able to grow and have the same opportunity, access, knowledge, and whatever else as me. 
> This blog idea started as a necessity. I need to share all that I am. That I am becoming. All that I have been. 

> There are things I need to share. Some things need to be shared because the word I gave people. Ideas that must be shared and given a chance to live. Journeys and adventures that I’ve always wanted to share and let others in on, but just hadn’t yet. I must share that knowledge that I gained so that others can also have access to that knowledge. Furthermore, have access to the many things that I've discovered and things that I continue to encounter. It’s my life purpose. It’s a thing I would die standing for. 

### The Goal

The current goal is to make something from nothing- Using what one already have. 

> **How?** 

Share the things already done, share the skills already honed, share the projects currently in progress, and the topics currently being mastering and resources on how to master them. Embrace the person one is.

#### Goals List

- [x] Create and Publish the Blog
- [ ] Connect Sanity 
- [ ] Fix Hosting Server

## The Vision

> This is totally beyond me. I'm a simple person. I want simple but I also want to bring back fun, chaotic, and creativity. So expect changes often, chaotic at times, and ultimately an option mode where people can have fun with themes.

## Hosting This Site

Hosting this site was a rush and headache, to say the least. Right now, it's literally hosting from two sites, where the main domain Redirects to the other one. Its annoying really. The site actually has to be rebuilt blog from scratch.

Hosting a site is always a hassle of a decision. There are many pre-made sites for blogs. Wordpress being the main one, then lots of complicated templates for people such as myself, who enjoy coding still.

Where and how you host is actually one of the most important decisions one can make. It does align with other questions we have to ask ourselves, but this is where we are first faced with making that decision.

## Building The Blog

Building the blog is decided once asked the other questions. It's something that should be thought about before deciding hosting, but it doesn't come up until hosting is brought up often.

As a programmer, this is thought of first actually, but generally it isn't. Some people will want to use a certain hosting and build around. Others will think I want to drag and drop, but they still tend to focus on hosting more than the actual build and features of the blog.

## Is it worth doing? 

**YES! WITHOUT A SINGLE DOUBT!**

## How Much Do I Share and How Do I Share Things?

> This is a tricky one, that I think will change based on my mood, although I will have to make a base. I think I almost share everything. At least a progress update once a week.

> I share enough to help convey messages, get points across, and have understanding of whatever the blog may be about. 

> I will share all ways, code blocks, pictures, videos, digital art, and any other way I learn to.
