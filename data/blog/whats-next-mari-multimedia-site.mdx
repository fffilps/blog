1. ## Mari MultiMedia Services 

We are attacking the Mari Multimedia Site this week (Jan. 1 - Jan. 7, 2023). The hardest part will be decision making again.

### What Decisions?

- Which pictures to use?
- Which designs to use?
- Which videos are worth while?
- Which websites are most suitable?
- What design am I wanting for the site?

### Current Vision vs Current Reality

#### Vision
My current vision for is it to be minimalistic and simple. **Grids**, **NavBar** to choose between the different media services portfolios, **Contact** page, **About** page, and then a good **Landing** page with peoples reviews.

#### Reality
Where we currently stand though, is different. Right now, it will be landing page, with a logo and my best works in each service area. Just so people can have a place to go as I build out the website.

2. ## Tobacco Ryan's Website

The beauty of this project is that there is not much design work for me to do, as we have already decided on the design. The harder part is actually implementing our vision for the website. 

I'll do more blog updates on this next week. Just know that it will be an innovative, fun, and memorable website experience.

3. ## OnThursdays Webshop

I will be making my bro a website shop for his brand. All us, no shopify. 

The idea is make it interactive and match the design of his next drop - **WATER**

It's also important that I mention that I will actually building the entire site from scratch with the help of Sanity and Stripe.
I have made a standard mock webshop already using the stack, so I now want to make more and offer it to people. I know there are limitations to shopify and headaches to build webshops through other providers, so that is where I come in. Not only that, but it's way cheaper.

4. ## Landing My First Software Engineering Role

This is a behind the scenes thing going on. I'm currently job searching for a role in either a tech company or a tech role as a software engineer. This is partially why this blog will have a focus in  my life, as it will play a part in helping create opportunities. 

Finding a job is a full-time job in itself. You have to search the jobs, fill out applications, create cover letters for each role, contact hiring managers, and do lots of research on each company you apply for. Honestly, you have to do research before applying just to make your resume, cover letter, and portfolio appeal to the specific company and the role they are offering.

5. ## Building SMSC

The site is up, in the most beta form to say the least. It's literally as basic as a site can get except I'm using React/Next instead of basic HTML (HONESTLY IT WAS BASIC HTML UNTIL I FIXED THE SERVER ISSUES). 
The site will over time have more videos, images, lookbooks, an area of the team, product shop, and possibly a skate game and skate dice on there. 

I'm looking foward to making the skate game and finishing the skate dice application. I made it a while ago on iOS, but dropped it when I had to make it work not only on iOS devices of WatchOS. That whole testing process was daughting as a beginner, but now I'm looking foward to it. 

There are other things going on with SMSC but those things are on the hush and will be talked about when they are.
